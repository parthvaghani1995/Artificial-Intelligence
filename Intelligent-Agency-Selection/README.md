# Intelligent Agency Selection

This is an intelligent agent which helps the player to select the best possible move to achieve its goal. Here there are two players SPLA and LASHA. Both the players have constraints which are described in detail in the ["Description File"](https://github.com/parthvaghani1995/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Intelligent-Agency-Selection/F18HW2_V2.pdf). Our agent will try maximizing SPLA which includes **MiniMax algorithm with AlphaBeta pruning**. This technique will increase the chances of getting the results faster. I have also used **Iterative Deepning at 2n levels** so that we get the best possible value at every iteration.

The method to run the code is given in the ["description"](https://github.com/parthvaghani1995/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Intelligent-Agency-Selection/F18HW2_V2.pdf).
